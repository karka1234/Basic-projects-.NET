I have recently started learning C# programming, here are some c# beginner exercises I have done.
They all are Console.Applications

Restaurant_controll_system - The restaurant staff can see the menu, tables, orders, pay and at the same time vacate the table, add to the order. (Dictionary in dictionary and then in list)
GAME_TicTacToe - just a game
GAME_MindGame - just a game

OOP :
Basic_ATM - basic ATM functions : check, put in, put out money and check old transactions. Data was saved in .txt / .csv files.
   
OOP_Restaurant_controll_system - The restaurant system is designed for efficient order management and table occupancy monitoring. The waitress can register a person's order by adding product names and prices from the "food.txt/csv" and "drinks.txt/csv" files. When selecting a table, it is marked as occupied, and when vacated, it is marked as free. Orders and table status are stored in files, thus maintaining their state between program shutdowns and openings.
    The order includes table information, such as the table number, the number of seats, the ordered dishes/drinks, and the total amount paid. The start and end date and time of the order are also recorded.
    Two receipts are generated from the order: one for the restaurant and one for the customer. The restaurant receipt is always printed and recorded in a file, while the customer's receipt may not be printed according to customer preferences.
    The program allows employees to obtain statistics on restaurant activities, including the total profit from today's orders, the number of unoccupied tables, and the number of free seats at occupied tables. It also provides a list of products added today.
    Additionally, a reservation feature has been created, allowing employees to reserve a table for a specific name and time, cancel a reservation, and monitor the status of reserved tables. Order files are structured by days, and authentication and employee tracking allow for secure operation management and employee statistics. Moreover, it is possible to add "teas," and this information will be reflected in receipts and statistics.
